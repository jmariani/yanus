==== 1.0.0.0
	- fix : autoinsert into workflow.
	- enh : replace function is_a() by instanceof	(kjharni on http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/12071-extension-simpleworkflow/page__view__findpost__p__128227)
	- enh : metadata. It is now possible to add any value to node definition by using the metadata attribute.
	- enh : workflow class definition. A workflow can be defined as a class that must implement method getDefinition(). This method returns the workflow
	definition in its array format.
	- enh : add 'leaveWorkflow' event. This event is fired whenever a component included in a workflow reset its status. This
	must be done from a final status only.

	- fix : replace 'split' with 'explode' (got 2 doodle)
	- enh : SWActiveRecordBehavior->swValidate now returns boolean 
	- enh : Workflow Driven Model Validation. It is now possible to define validators which are only
	executed upon specific transitions (this is done by defining specific scenario names).
